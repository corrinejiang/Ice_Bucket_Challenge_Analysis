# Twitter Ice Bucket Challenge Analysis

As one of the incurable and fatal diseases, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is currently affecting more than 200,000 people around the world, where patients will gradually become paralyzed due to loss of communication between the brain and muscles. This deadly disease had received little attention around the globe until 2014 when an unprecedented campaign called Ice Bucket Challenge was raised on the Internet. Participants would pour cold water over their heads to experience the “freeze” symptom of ALS and challenge their friends to do so as well to raise attention from society. The campaign has gone viral in only several months and become one of the most influential charity movements in internet history.

In this project, we will explore what role the social media (Twitter) played during the famous Ice Bucket Challenge campaign in 2014 and how it influenced the trend of this charity movement from two perspectives: first, we will apply methods such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis to investigate the thoughts and attitudes of Twitter users had towards this campaign. By integrating scores generated with time labels, we could come up with detailed trend plots to gain a deeper understanding. Second, network analysis will be used to examine how the ALS association and other influencers/celebrities contributed to this campaign.
